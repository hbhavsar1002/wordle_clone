# Wordle Clone  

I have been addicted to playing [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) so I decided to create a clone of it. 
Wordle is a popular online word game where users get 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word. 

## Instruction
After each guess the game provides a feedback by changing the color of tiles to indicate how close the guess word is to the final word. 
For example, if you enter guess word as FIRST and press enter, the color of tiles will be changed to

I is present in the final word and is in the correct position.

S and T are present in the final word but are not in the correct position. 

F and R are not present in the final word.

The correct word is

## Database

I have selected words for the puzzle from word finder of [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordfinder/classic/begins/common/5/a/1). The Wordle puzzle is generated by randomly selcting word from words.json file.
<br>To check if the guess word entered by the user is valid or present in dictionary I have used [FreeDictiony API](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI).
Also, in case the API does not work or it returns an error, I have used this [wordlist](https://gist.github.com/dracos/dd0668f281e685bad51479e5acaadb93) to check the validity of the guess word.
